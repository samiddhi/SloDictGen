Phase Overview:

I. Development
 - grammar tables
    - testing
 - sskj
    - testing
    - translation
       -very careful dev should be done in slow batches to ensure quality with regular testing of each
 - combination

II. Testing
 - testing on randomly selected elements, reformatting as needed

III. Launch
 - Give it to myself who will be using it :)

	- get rid of dict added entry
	- grey top bar not aligned with table

    dictionary with key as grammar name and item as the WordForm object

(4.1.24): 10:00-2:00
- Made the code work again as is (formatting the html stuff, finishing the
      migration to formatting.py NOUNS ONLY)
- Entry and WordForm converted to dataclasses.
    - now STRICTLY contain only data parsed from the XML - other nonsense
      refactored to more sensible destinations
        - refactoring formatting was a lot of effort!
- XML parser became a class, packaged w/ Entry & WordForm in entry_parser.py

- Created git repo
